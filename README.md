Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. This milestone was to create a state machine that would turn a light on when on is typed and off when off is typed using the UART

What did you do particularly well? I thing I handled testing to ensure that the program worked with edge cases such as oon and ofon.

Where could you improve? I could have broken down the code into reusable functions especially in the initialization in main for the UART.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network? Learning how to work with UART is both a valuable skill to know, and was really fun and cool to see a direct link between what you type and how the light reacts.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work? The skills from this milestone were directly transferable to the main project, as we needed to use the UART to communicate the temperature, setpoints, whether the heater is on or off, and elapsed seconds.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable? I tried to use descriptive names for the variables and enums, and use all of the 10 guidelines for best practices in coding.
