Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. This milestone was to create a state machine that would turn a light on when on is typed and off when off is typed using the UART

What did you do particularly well? I thing I handled testing to ensure that the program worked with edge cases such as oon and ofon.

Where could you improve? I could have broken down the code into reusable functions.
What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
